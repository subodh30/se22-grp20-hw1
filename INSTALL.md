# Installing Python

For running python scripts, you need to install Python 3 from the official website.
```
$ sudo apt-get update
$ sudo apt-get install python3.6
```
To test if you have a successful installation of Python then try for following command
```
$ python --version
```
If the output is shown as v3.x.x then that means that you have a successful installation complete.
